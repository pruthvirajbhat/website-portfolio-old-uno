This post is an intro into picoCTF - creating an account and working with all the CTF challenges the platform has. Firstly. the account was created and the basic-file-exploit was done (as shown in the john hammond walkthrough video). 

More and more CTF activities exist with resources about different topics to learn from.

Same as hackthebox or any other platform to explore and begin working there too (like CTFlearn).
